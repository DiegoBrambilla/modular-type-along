# Lesson material for "modular code development" lesson

Type-along/demo where we discuss and experience aspects of (un)modular code development.


## Starting questions for the hackpad

We share these questions in a common hackpad (https://hackmd.io) and we wait until we have sufficiently many
answers to question 1. But we also encourage answering questions 2-4 which we revisit at the end of the demo.

1. What does "modular code development" mean for you?
2. What best practices can you recommend to arrive at well structured, modular code in your favourite programming language?
3. What would you recommend your colleague who starts in the same programming language?
4. How do you deal with code complexity in your projects?
